    "   - How to generate the overall plot specified by those widget values, starting from the basic [hvPlot](http://hvplot.pyviz.org)-based object and modifying it using [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org) and [Datashader](http://datashader.org).\n",
    "   - Which functions need to be run when one of the widget values changes<br><br>\n",

You should be able to add new datasets easily to `catalog.yml` by copying the description of the simplest dataset (e.g. `osm-1b`). If you wish, you can then compare that dataset's description to the other datasets, to see how other fields and metadata can be added if you want there to be more options for users to explore a particular dataset. Similarly, you can easily add additional items to lay out in rows and columns in the `panel` app; it should be trivial to add anything Panel supports (text boxes, images, other separate plots, etc.) to this layout as described at [Panel.org](http://panel.pyviz.org).

Well, if you do try the `view` version, you should be able to see that it works but it is not very responsive, because Panel re-runs the whole `view()` function every single time any widget changes value. Re-running everything makes it possible to support every library, but even for a 50k dataset, the resulting plot flickers any time a widget is used. For a larger dataset there can be a very annoying lag, as the entire plot is rebuilt from scratch. Slider widgets in particular can be very confusing with a lag like that, making it difficult to explore the data. So this simple version is not the most usable, but it's still a good first pass -- it makes all the right widgets and connects them all up to control the plot that you see. If that's good enough, then you can stop there!"

    "### Expressing fine-grained dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "So what if we do anticipate working with larger files and still want the interface to be responsive wherever possible, using HoloViews? The full `viewable` object and associated functions show how to ensure that only the specific bits of code that depend directly on each parameter are re-run when that widget is changed, making it highly reponsive even with large datasets.  For instance, the `map_opacity` slider affects only the underlying map tiles, and so with `viewable` that slider can be dragged with instantaneous updating regardless of the dataset size; the data plot stays the same while the tiles update.  The `spreading` and `cmap` widgets do need to access the data, but even they can still be very fast, because they affect only the very last step in the data processing, after aggregation but before the final display.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how is this fine-grained control over bits of computation achieved? First, you'll notice that `viewable` is named as an adjective rather than the imperative \"`view()`\" function that is a verb. We provided the `view` function directly to Panel, and Panel keeps track of its dependencies and calls `view` every time a widget's parameter changes, generating a completely new plot.  But `viewable` is a fixed HoloViews object, not a function call, with this object provided to Panel.  `viewable` is a dynamically updatable object from HoloViews whose parts are precisely tied internally to each of the relevant parameters. (Hence the perhaps too-subtle difference in the names of those two items; one is a command to view immediately, and the other is a viewable object that can be kept around and viewed at will.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the `viewable` object, first consider a simpler version that doesn't display the data at all:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "viewable2 = hv.DynamicMap(tiles) * hv.DynamicMap(labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `hv.DynamicMap(callback)` returns a dynamic HoloViews object that calls the provided `callback` whenever the object needs updating.  When given a Panel-decorated function, `hv.DynamicMap` understands any dependencies that have been declared for that function.  In this case, the map tiles will thus be dynamically updated whenever the `map_opacity` or `basemap` widgets change, and the overlaid labels will be updated whenever the `show_labels` widget changes (because those are the relationships expressed on `def tiles()` and `def labels()` with the `pn.depends` decorator in their declaration).  The `viewable2` object here is then an overlay (constructed by the `*` syntax for HoloViews objects), retaining the underlying dynamic behavior of the two overlaid items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still following along? If not, try viewing `viewable2` and playing around with the source code to see how those parts fit together. Once that all makes sense, then we could add in a plot of the actual data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "viewable3 = hv.DynamicMap(tiles) * hv.DynamicMap(elem) * hv.DynamicMap(labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as before, we use a `DynamicMap` to call the `.elem()` method whenever one of its parameter dependencies changes (`plot` in this case).  Don't actually try to display `viewable3`, though, unless you have a very small dataset (even the tiny `nyc_taxi_50k` may be too large for some browsers).  As written, this code will pass all the data on to your browser, with disastrous results for large datasets!  This is where Datashader comes in; to make it safe for large data, we can instead wrap this object in some HoloViews operations that turn it into something safe to display:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "viewable4 = hv.DynamicMap(tiles) * spread(shade(rasterize(hv.DynamicMap(elem)))) * hv.DynamicMap(labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This version is now runnable, with `rasterize()` dynamically aggregating the data using Datashader whenever a new plot is needed, `shade()` then dynamically colormapping the data into an RGB image, and `spread()` dynamically spreading isolated pixels so that they become visible data points.  But if you try it, you'll notice that the plot is ignoring all of the rasterization, shading, and spreading parameters we declared above, because those parameters are not declared as dependencies of the `elem` method that was given to this DynamicMap.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We could of course add those parameters as dependencies to `.elem`, but if we do that, then the whole set of chained operations will need to be re-run every time any one of those parameters changes, just like for the clunky `view()` function above. For a large dataset, re-running all those steps can take seconds or even minutes, yet some of the changes only affect the very last (and very cheap) stages of the computation, such as `spread` or `shade`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we come to the final version of `viewable` that's used in the actual code above, which creates a whole slew of chained `hv.DynamicMap` objects that each dynamically respond to _some_ of the possible user actions:\n",
    "- `hv.DynamicMap(elem)` returns an appropriate HoloViews element whenever the `plot` widget changes\n",
    "- `rasterized` applies the Datashader aggregation operation to the result of `hv.DynamicMap(elem)` whenever that result changes or when the dependencies of the `aggregator` function change (the `field` and `agg_fn` widgets)\n",
    "- `shaded` applies the Datashader shading operation to the result of `rasterized` whenever that result changes or the `cmap` and `normalization` widgets change.\n",
    "- `dataplot` sets options on the result of `shaded` whenever that result changes or the `data_opacity` widget value changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only discussed how `pn.depends()` allows a function to declare its dependencies, but there are actually currently three different ways to set up dynamic, responsive behavior with Panel widgets, of which `viewable` uses methods 2 and 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function dependency for Panel**: Decorating a function definition with  `pn.depends(name = widget)` (equivalent to `pn.depends(name = widget.param.value)`), and passing that function to Panel so that Panel will call the function when any of the dependencies changes (used for the clunky `view()` function, but not for the responsive `viewable` object). Completely general, but very coarse-grained; useful for a first pass, for simple cases, and for plotting libraries not supporting more fine-grained approaches.\n",
    "2. **Function dependency for HoloViews DynamicMap**: Decorating a function with `pn.depends(name = widget)`, and passing that function to a HoloViews DynamicMap so that HoloViews will call the function when any of the dependencies change (used for most of the functions above).\n",
    "3. **Widget instance-object argument**: Supplying a Panel widget object (or its associated Parameter object `obj.param.value`) as an argument to a HoloViews Operation, DynamicMap, or `.apply()` call, instead of supplying a concrete value like an integer or float. Providing the widget or its underlying parameter will cause that operation to re-run its computation when the widget value changes.  This approach is used for the `dataplot` object, which responds dynamically to `cmap`, `normalization`, `spreading`, and `data_opacity` because those widgets are supplied like  `px=spreading` (the widget) or `px=spreading.param.value` (the widget's Parameter object) rather than `px=spreading.value` (which would immediately look up the current value and would thus simply be equivalent to `px=0` if the current value of `spreading` is 0).  Dependencies are inferred only when the whole widget or its underlying Parameter object is supplied, not just the current value of the widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaches 2 and 3 are based on a feature of HoloViews called [streams](http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Responding_to_Events.html#Introducing-streams), which support many types of dynamic behavior other than responding to widgets. For instance, the `rasterize` operation attaches a `RangeXY` stream that re-aggregates the data whenever the viewport (x or y range) changes, as a user zooms or pans a Bokeh plot. Other streams can be created manually to perform custom behavior, such as consuming streaming data sources, reacting to arbitrary plot events, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sources of dynamic behavior make the `dataplot` chain of HoloViews DynamicMaps be richly interactive. The interactive `dataplot` is then overlaid with `hv.DynamicMap(tiles)` (which itself is updated when the `map_opacity` and `basemap` widgets change), and with `hv.DynamicMap(labels)` (which itself is updated when the `show_labels` widget changes). Now, each part of the plot updates only if the relevant widgets have changed, and otherwise is left as it was, avoiding flicker and providing snappy performance.\n",

    "As you can see, if we want to be very careful to tie each bit of computation to the values that affect it, then we can precisely determine which code to re-run interactively, providing maximal responsiveness where possible (try dragging the opacity sliders or selecting colormaps), while re-running everything when needed (when aggregation-related widgets change). In your own Panel dashboards and apps, you can often use the simplest approach (which can be as simple as a one-line call to [interact](https://panel.pyviz.org/user_guide/Interact.html)), but it is important to know that fine-grained control is available when you need it, and is still typically vastly more concise and explicitly expressed than with other dashboarding approaches."
