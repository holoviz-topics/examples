# Allows to build multiple projects in a matrix.
# - found out which projects to build
# - if any, build them in a matrix

# This runs on:
# - workflow_call: this is used by pr_flow.yml to build multiple projects (PUSHING the results to a branch)
# - workflow_dispatch: to manually trigger builds (NOT pushing the results to any branch),
#   optionally listing the projects targeted 
# - schedule: once a month for all of them (NOT pushing the results to any branch)
