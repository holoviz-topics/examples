In the past ten years in particular, campaigns like Kepler, K2, and TESS have produced an explosion of results. To date, approximately 4,400 exoplanets have been identified, and over 3,000 potential exoplanet candidates have been discovered. \n",

Here, we'll use the [equatorial coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system) provided in the original datasets. Equatorial coordinates are given by two angles: ``ra`` (right ascension) and ``dec`` (declination). ``ra`` and ``dec`` represent the position of an object on an imaginary sphere called the celestial sphere, with the Earth at its center and an equator that's a projection of the Earth's equator. Right ascension measures the horizontal position of the object on that sphere, and is usually given in either hours or degrees (our datasets use degrees). Declination measures the vertical position of the object. Because these coordinates are defined based on the tilt and shape of the Earth independent of its rotation, the equatorial positions of celestial objects do not change over the course of a day or a year.\n",

For water to be present on the planet as liquid, the planet's temperature must be within a fairly narrow range, and therefore the planet must be within a certain distance of the nearest star. Exoplanets within this range are said to be in the \"Goldilocks zone.\"\n",

    "In the plot above, we can see that most planets have a mass under 2000 times Earth's and radii under 20 times Earth's, but there are a few outliers. The exoplanet with the largest mass in our dataset is the gas giant [HR 2562-b](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7229/hr-2562-b/), whose mass is over 9000 times Earth's, but whose radius is only about 12 times Earth's.\n",

    "[HD 100546 b](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/6713/hd-100546-b/) has the largest radius compared to Earth's, dwarfing our planet by a factor of 77 (that's the big blue planet in the `planets()` plot). On the other side of the scale, the smallest planet in radius is [Kepler-62 c](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/373/kepler-62-c/), whose radius is about half of Earth's, but whose mass is quadruple Earth's.\n",

Temperature and radius appear to have a positive correlation.\n",
