In the past ten years in particular, campaigns like Kepler, K2, and TESS have produced an explosion of results. To date, approximately 4,400 exoplanets have been identified, and over 3,000 potential exoplanet candidates have been discovered. \n",

Right ascension measures the horizontal position of the object on that sphere, and is usually given in either hours or degrees (our datasets use degrees).

On the other side of the scale, the smallest planet in radius is [Kepler-62 c](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/373/kepler-62-c/), whose radius is about half of Earth's, but whose mass is quadruple Earth's.\n",
