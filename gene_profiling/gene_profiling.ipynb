    "## Introduction\n",
    "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of tumor heterogeneity, immune microenvironments, and treatment resistance mechanisms in cancer. However, the complexity and scale of these datasetsâ€”often containing millions of cells and thousands of genesâ€”present significant analytical challenges for cancer researchers. This workflow demonstrates how interactive visualization tools can transform the exploration of single-cell cancer data from a technical programming exercise into an intuitive visual discovery process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Cancer Research\n",
    "\n",
    "In cancer biology, understanding tumor cellular heterogeneity is crucial for:\n",
    "- **Identifying rare cell populations** that may drive metastasis or treatment resistance\n",
    "- **Characterizing tumor microenvironment interactions** between cancer cells, immune cells, and stromal cells\n",
    "- **Discovering novel therapeutic targets** through differential gene expression analysis\n",
    "- **Monitoring treatment response** at single-cell resolution to understand mechanisms of resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow showcases two complementary visualization approachesâ€”**ManifoldMap** for exploring cellular landscapes and **DotMap** for validating cell group assignmentsâ€”that when linked together, enable powerful hypothesis-driven exploration of cancer datasets.\n"
