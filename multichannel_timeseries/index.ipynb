    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing time series from various sources on a vertically stacked, time-aligned display is often the first tool employed when working with data from [electrophysiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) studies. These experiments generally seek to provide insight into the activities of nerve cells or muscles, as well as how they relate to each other or other measurable variables, such as the spatial position of the organism under study. Electrophysiological recording sessions can include diverse data types like electromyograms (EMG), electroencephalograms (EEG), local field potentials (LFP), or neural action potentials (spikes) - each consisting of multiple streams of information ('channels') that all are unified by their alignment to a single series of timestamps, but having a heterogenuous range of amplitude values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different approaches for a visualization of multichannel timeseries data, but we'll highlight the one that we've found to be promising in many scenarios. If you have a dataset that is too large to fit into memory, check out the alternate approaches in the 'Extensions and Alternate Workflows' below the Recommended Workflow."

    "### Key Features\n",
    "Analyzing electrophysiological data often involves searching for patterns across time, channels, and covariates. Target features that support this type of investigation for time-aligned, amplitude-diverse data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smooth Interactions at Scale:** Smooth zooming and panning across time and channels.\n",
    "- **Subcoordinate Axes:** Independent amplitude dimension (y-axis) per channel.\n",
    "- **Instant Inspection:** Quick information preview about the data under the cursor.\n",
    "- **Group-Aware Handling:** Zooming and y-range normalization per specified channel group/type.\n",
    "- **Reference View:** Minimap for navigation and contextualization in large datasets.\n",
    "- **Responsive Scale Bar:** Dynamic amplitude reference measurement.\n",
    "- **Time-Range Annotations:** Create and edit time-range annotations directly on the plot."
