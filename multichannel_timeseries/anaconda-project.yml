  # This indicates the system not to run them, in which case
  # the notebooks should be committed in their evaluated form
  # in the repository.

# [REQUIRED] list of the channels needed to solve the environment
channels:
- conda-forge
- nodefaults

# [REQUIRED] list of the direct dependencies needed to run the project.
# Good practice is to pin their minimum version (>=) to indicate the
# version with which the project has been created. Updates to the project
# should in practice update these pins.

# [REQUIRED] define the commands the project user may run (e.g. anaconda-project run notebook)
commands:
  # if you intend to run notebooks, set the `notebook` command
  notebook:
    # reference a single notebook in your project
    notebook: index.ipynb
    # shortcut to open all the notebook
    # notebook: .
  # if you intend to declare a deployment of a panel/lumen app, set the `dashboard` command
  dashboard:
    # for a deployment, the `--rest-session-info --session-history -1` options are required
    unix: panel serve --rest-session-info --session-history -1 index.ipynb
    supports_http_options: true
  # [OPTIONAL] a project can have a test command that references the 'test' env_spec
  # if not, the project will be tested automatically by the system
  # test:
  #   unix: pytest --nbsmoke-run -k ".ipynb" --ignore envs
  #   windows: pytest --nbsmoke-run -k ".ipynb" --ignore envs
  #   env_spec: test

# [OPTIONAL] declare the test env specs
# env_specs:
#   default: {}
