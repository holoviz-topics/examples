    "For an introduction, please visit the ['Index'](./index.ipynb) page. This workflow is tailored for processing and analyzing large multichannel timeseries data derived from [electrophysiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) recordings. It is more experimental and complex than the recommended workflow but, at the time of writing, provides a scalable solution at the cutting edge of development.\n",

    "### What Defines a 'Large-Sized' Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "A 'large-sized' dataset in this context is characterized by its size surpassing the available memory, making it impossible to load the entire dataset into RAM simultaneously. So, how are we to visualize a zoomed-out representation of the entire large dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilizing a Large Data Pyramid\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 'medium' workflow, we employed downsampling to reduce the volume of data transferred to the browser, a technique feasible when the entire dataset already resides in memory. For larger datasets, however, we now adopt an additional strategy: the creation and dynamic access to a data pyramid. A data pyramid involves storing multiple layers of the dataset at varying resolutions, where each successive layer is a downsampled version of the previous one. For instance, when fully zoomed out, a greatly downsampled version of the data provides a quick overview, guiding users to areas of interest. Upon zooming in, tiles of higher-resolution pyramid levels are dynamically loaded. This strategy outlined is similar to the approach used in geosciences for managing interactive map tiles, and which has also been adopted in bio-imaging for handling high-resolution electron microscopy images. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Software:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside [HoloViz](https://github.com/holoviz), [Bokeh](https://holoviz.org/), and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), we make extensive use of several open source libraries to implement our solution:\n",
    "- **[Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray):** Manages labeled multi-dimensional data, facilitating complex data operations and enabling partial data loading for out-of-core computation.\n",
    "- **[Xarray DataTree](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree):** Organizes xarray DataArrays and Datasets into a logical tree structure, making it easier to manage and access different resolutions of the dataset. At the moment of writing, this is [actively being migrated](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/8572) into the core Xarray library.\n",
    "- **[Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask):** Adds parallel computing capabilities, managing tasks that exceed memory limits.\n",
    "- **[ndpyramid](https://github.com/carbonplan/ndpyramid):** Specifically designed for creating multi-resolution data pyramids.\n",
    "- **[Zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python):** Used for storing the large arrays of the data pyramid on disk in a compressed, chunked, and memory-mappable format, which is crucial for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "- **[tsdownsample](https://github.com/predict-idlab/tsdownsample):** Provides optimized implementations of downsampling algorithms that help to maintain important aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations and Trade-offs\n",
    "While this approach allows visualization and interaction with datasets larger than available memory, it does introduce certain trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased Storage Requirement:** Constructing a data pyramid currently requires additional disk space since multiple representations of the data are stored.\n",
    "- **Code Complexity:** Creating the pyramids still involves a fair bit of familiarity with the key packages, and their interoperability. Also, the plotting code involved in dynamic access to the data pyramid structure is still experimental, and could be matured into HoloViz or another codebase in the future.\n",
    "- **Performance:** While this method can handle large datasets, the performance may not match that of handling smaller datasets due to the overhead associated with processing and dynamically loading multiple layers of the pyramid."
