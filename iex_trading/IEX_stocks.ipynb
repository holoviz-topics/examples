    "\n",
    "In the [previous notebook](./IEX_trading.ipynb), we saw how all the trades on the IEX stock exchange could be interactively visualized over the course of a whole day (Monday 21st of October 2019). Using HoloViews with Datashader and Bokeh, all the trades are rasterized interactively to reveal the density of trades via a colormap.\n",
    "\n",
    "When viewing a million trades at once for a whole day, it is extremely difficult to identify individual trades using a global view. In order to identify particular trades, it is necessary to zoom into a time window small enough that individual trades can be distinguished at which point the trade metadata can be inspected using the HoloViews hover tool. What the global visualization helps reveal is the overall pattern of trades. In this notebook, we will focus on interactively revealing the trading patterns for individual stocks by partitioning on a set of stock symbols selected with a widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will use the following Python packages:\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data manipulation and analysis\n",
    "- [Datashader](https://datashader.org/): Aggregates big datasets into a fixed-sized array suitable for display in the browser\n",
    "- [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/): Flexibly combines each of the data sources into a just-in-time displayale, interactive plot\n",
    "- [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/): Creates interactive dashboards to allow the data to be more easily explored.\n",
