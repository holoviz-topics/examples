    "\n",
    "The [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) Python plotting library lets users build interactive apps and plots in a web browser for a very wide variety of data types.  The high-level library [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org) builds on Bokeh, making it easier to use for common data-processing tasks, and the corresponding [GeoViews](https://geoviews.org) library adds support for plotting in geographic coordinate systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools now (as of development releases in 1/2020) all support interactively collecting data _from_ the user, not just interacting with existing data, with components provided by HoloViews (and by GeoViews for data on maps) that make it simple to get data into Python ready to process and use for tagging data for machine-learning pipelines (or any other purpose!). These \"annotation\" and \"drawing\" tools can be used to annotate existing data sets or geographic locations, to classify each example or regions into categories or with numeric or other labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools make it possible to work directly with data in its native values (*as data*) and then immediately use it for further processing in Python. Other tools like [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) will usually be faster and easier to use for the specific things they do, so if one of those meets your need, use it! Meanwhile, use the Bokeh/HoloViews annotation tools if you want to quickly create a fully custom app for special purposes, especially if you want to stay working with data you are already using in Python, in its native coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will focus only on the easy-to-use, high-level [\"annotator\" components from HoloViews](http://build.holoviews.org/user_guide/Annotators.html); fully custom control is always available by using [Bokeh's drawing tools](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/tools.html#bokeh.models.tools.PointDrawTool) directly."

    "As you can see above, it's fairly straightforward to build an annotator to collect a specific type of data. To collect data at a large scale, you'll want to focus on usability, which will often mean creating a special-purpose app to collect data across multiple images, multiple datasets, by multiple raters, etc. Doing so is beyond the scope of this introduction, but can be straightforward using the separate [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) library for building apps, also based on Bokeh and having full support for HoloViews. The annotator objects can be included directly in a Panel layout and connected to other Panel objects for seamless updating and integration into a larger workflow.\n",
