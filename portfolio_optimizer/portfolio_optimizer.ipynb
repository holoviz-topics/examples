    "Portfolio Optimization helps financial investors construct portfolios to maximize expected return given a certain level of market risk, emphasizing the inherent relationship between risk and reward. We will begin by running an example of the Monte Carlo Simulation for an optimal portfolio with resulting returns. Then we will create an Efficient Frontier, which is used to identify a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. This will be done using hvPlot and HoloViews, which will allow users to visualize the trade-offs between risk and return. Lastly, we will combine all our analyses into a Panel app that enables users to dynamically explore the Efficient Frontier, adjust parameters, and visualize the resulting portfolios, streamlining the portfolio optimization process.\n",
