    "## Extract a coast- and shoreline contour with GrabCut\n",
    "\n",
    "The GrabCut algorithm provides a way to annotate an image using polygons or lines to demark the foreground and background. The algorithm estimates the color distribution of the target object and that of the background using a Gaussian mixture model. This is used to construct a Markov random field over the pixel labels, with an energy function that prefers connected regions having the same label, and running a graph-cut-based optimization to infer their values. This procedure is repeated until convergence, resulting in an image mask denoting the foreground and background.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example this algorithm is applied to map tiles to automatically extract a coast or shoreline contour. First we specify a rectangular region in which to download the map tiles using the `SelectRegionPanel`, then we can declare the ``GrabCutPanel`` to annotate the region and let the algorithm compute a contour."

    "Pressing the ``Update Contour`` runs the *GrabCut* algorithm on the selected region with the foreground and background polygons/paths given as input. The output of this process is a contour that delineates the foreground and background. This countour is also filtered and simplified to make it smaller to export and easier to edit. Try to set ``Minimum size`` to 1 and ``Tolerance`` to 200 to observe the effects of filtering and simplifying the contour, respectively. To speed up the calculation we can also downsample the image before applying the Grabcut algorithm by reducing the value of ``magnification``.\n",
