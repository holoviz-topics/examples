    "## Extract a coast- and shoreline contour with GrabCut\n",
    "\n",
    "The GrabCut algorithm provides a way to annotate an image using polygons or lines to demark the foreground and background. The algorithm estimates the color distribution of the target object and that of the background using a Gaussian mixture model. This is used to construct a Markov random field over the pixel labels, with an energy function that prefers connected regions having the same label, and running a graph cut based optimization to infer their values. This procedure is repeated until convergence, resulting in an image mask denoting the foreground and background.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example this algorithm is applied to map tiles to automatically extract a coast- and shoreline contour. First we specify a region to download the map tiles in using the `SelectRegionPanel`, then we can declare the ``GrabCutPanel`` to annotate the region and let the algorithm compute a contour. "
